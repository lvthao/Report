NETWORKING ON OPENSTACK: 
There are two kind of network : nova-network service and neutron 
	Mutil host networking is when we run nova-service on the all of compute node and the instance on that compute will use the compute node as a gateway to  the internet. It need one public ip as a compute node to communication to the internet 
	Single host networking is when we run nova-service only the controller node and instance will use the controller as a gateway to the internet. The disadvantage is create a single point failure. if the controller is not available, the instance cannot communication to the internet. 

Neutron : two type of network :Tennant network and provider network 

Tenant creates his own network(s), router(s), allowing complex network topologies for multi-tier applications


flat or VLAN, shared or tenant, or provider or overlay

Network namespaces is a very cool Linux feature can be used for many purposes and is heavily used in OpenStack networking. Network namespaces are isolated containers which can hold a network configuration and is not seen from outside of the namespace. A network namespace can be used to encapsulate specific network functionality or provide a network service in isolation as well as simply help to organize a complicated network setup

Linux bridge is used to connect the port from OVS to the VM. Every port goes from the OVS bridge to a Linux bridge and from there to the VM. The reason for using regular Linux bridges is for security groupsâ€™ enforcement. Security groups are implemented using iptables and iptables can only be applied to Linux bridges and not to OVS bridges.
